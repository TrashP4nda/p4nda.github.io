## What I’ve Been Up to This Year – Full Stack Journey, the Tech Market, and Looking Ahead

Hey everyone! 👋

As the year wraps up, it’s time to take a look back at what I’ve been up to—because why not, right? It’s been a year full of challenges, tech experiments, and the constant feeling that I’m somehow both learning and running in place. So, let’s dive into what I’ve been doing, tech-wise, and a little about the lovely chaos of the job market!


### Full-Stack Development: Angular, React, and .NET EF Core

This year, I’ve had my hands in several projects that required me to build everything from scratch. And I do mean *everything*. From setting up the back-end to crafting pixel-perfect front-end interfaces, I’ve been responsible for it all. Let’s break it down:

- ***Angular & React***: Depending on the project, I’ve been using Angular or React. Angular’s structured, component-based architecture was perfect for larger-scale applications, while React’s flexibility made it ideal for more dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I’ve had the chance to build both dashboards and more user-focused applications, ensuring smooth data flow and high-performance UIs.

- ***.NET EF Core***: The heavy lifting on the back-end was powered by .NET EF Core. It’s been a great tool for building out robust APIs, especially when paired with SQL Server or MySQL databases. I handled everything from data modeling to business logic and API security. Think of it as creating the brains of the app—ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Oh, and let’s not forget integrating authentication, authorization, and other security measures, because that’s always a joy when you’re working solo, right?

- ***MongoDB & MySQL***: For projects that needed flexibility in handling unstructured data, MongoDB was my go-to. Working with NoSQL databases has been a bit of a different experience, but it’s been crucial for handling data that doesn’t fit into neat little rows and columns. MySQL on the other hand has been my loyal companion this year long haha!

- ***Docker***: Then there’s Docker—the unsung hero of my year. Containerizing apps has made deployment a breeze, and let’s be real, there’s no better feeling than setting up an environment that works seamlessly across development, testing, and production. No more "*but it worked on my machine*" moments!

- ***Frontend Angular Project***: I’ve also worked on a front-end project built entirely in Angular, which gave me the chance to really dive deep into building highly interactive, responsive user interfaces. Integrating APIs and building out components that users actually enjoy using—what’s not to love? (Besides all the late nights debugging, but hey, that’s part of the fun, right? * ***cries*** *)

### The Solo Dev Life:

Now, being a solo dev is a bit like trying to juggle chainsaws—while riding a unicycle—on a tightrope. You get the idea. Time management? Ha! It’s been more like a constant scramble to get things done before the next deadline hits. I’ve been crunched, stretched thin, and tasked with handling *everything*. I mean, who knew a "*junior*" developer was supposed to manage entire projects from the back-end services to deployment?

Honestly, it’s been tough to actually learn when you’re trying to juggle a dozen responsibilities at once. Instead of growing in the way I’d hoped, I’ve been playing catch-up, firefighting bugs, and trying to meet unrealistic expectations. And let me tell you—rewarding? *Not exactly*. It’s been more about surviving than thriving, but hey, I’ve learned a lot about project management, if nothing else!

### The Tech Job Market: A Glorious Mess

Now, let’s talk about the state of the tech job market, shall we? Trying to find a job as a dev these days is like trying to win the lottery—except instead of a payout, you get a soul-crushing recruitment process filled with rejection emails or interview loops that could rival an Olympic marathon. You see job postings for junior devs that list about 87 required skills, and you're left wondering if you're supposed to have been coding since you were in diapers.

Everyone’s scrambling for positions, and even seasoned devs are having a tough time finding roles that allow for growth. The competition is fierce, and it feels like every interview process is designed to test your endurance more than your actual skills. It’s no wonder burnout is skyrocketing, but hey, we’ll just keep on grinding, right? At least we have GitHub Copilot to keep us company while we drown in code.

### Fitness and How It Changed My Life

In addition to my tech adventures, this year I’ve fully embraced fitness—and let me tell you, it’s been life-changing. Getting into fitness, from calisthenics to strength training, has helped me transform both physically and mentally. It’s not just about the gains (though they’re nice 😎); it’s about the discipline, the focus, and how it helps me clear my mind when the coding gets tough.

I’ve been working out consistently, pushing my limits, and finding a whole new passion in staying active. Honestly, fitness has given me the energy to keep up with the demands of life and the pressures of work. From early morning workouts to late-night training sessions, this journey has been just as fulfilling as my tech career—if not more. I’ve come to realize that health is just as important as professional growth, and it’s amazing how much more I can accomplish when I feel good physically.

### Looking Ahead: New Goals and Cybersecurity

Despite all the craziness, I’m still pushing forward. My goal for next year? Find a better job that gives me room to actually *learn* and grow as a developer. I want to focus on refining my skills and (fingers crossed) finally getting some time to explore cybersecurity—something I’ve been itching to dive into. With some breathing room, I can start working on ethical hacking and penetration testing, which has always been on my radar.

### Wrapping Up

So, to sum it up: this year has been a whirlwind of full-stack development, Docker magic, and battling through the job market jungle. But I’m ready for the next chapter, whether that’s leveling up my dev skills or diving into the exciting world of cybersecurity. Here’s to hoping for fewer job rejections and more growth opportunities!

Thanks for reading—stay tuned for more updates (and hopefully fewer rants about the tech market)!
