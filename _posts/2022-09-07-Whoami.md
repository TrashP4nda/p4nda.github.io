## Welcome to My Journey!

Hey there! The name’s Trash_P4nda—part-time coder, full-time mischief-maker navigating the worlds of tech, infosec, and everything in between. By day, I’m working as a full-stack developer (fancy, right?), but by night (and sometimes lunch breaks), I’m diving headfirst into whatever catches my interest—be it cybersecurity, tech news, or even my latest workout routine. Why limit myself, *right*?

Now, let’s be real for a second: I’m a total newbie in the cybersecurity world, but I’ve got one thing going for me—a love for challenges and a bad habit of turning everything into a joke. If you’re expecting some ultra-serious, no-nonsense tech blog, you’ve come to the wrong corner of the internet! This place is all about learning, experimenting, and probably messing up a few things along the way (in both code and workouts). But hey, that’s how we level up, right?

Here, I’ll document my journey—from wrecking Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges (or getting wrecked, who knows?) to talking about fitness goals, exercises, and calisthenics tricks that I’m working on. It’s all about balance, and I believe tech and fitness can go hand in hand. I'll also be sharing write-ups—whether it's about CTFs, exercise routines, or tech—complete with strategies, mistakes, and "ah-ha!" moments. Spoiler alert: there will be jokes.

But wait, there’s more! While tech and fitness are my main jams, I’m not going to limit myself. If I stumble across some cool tech news, web stuff, or even a random geeky thing that makes me go “Whoa, people need to know about this!”, I’ll toss it up here too. Consider it a bonus round of randomness—because, why not?

In between, I might throw in some articles about the cool tech I stumble upon, the tools I get my hands on, or the workout moves that make me go, “Wait, how is this even possible?” Whether it’s tech or fitness, it’s all fair game on this blog, and hopefully, you’ll pick up a few things along the way (or at least get a laugh).

One quick heads-up: I’m working full-time as a developer, so this site might not get updates as often as I’d like—life’s funny like that. But whenever I find time to squeeze in some cyber-chaos, fitness fun, or tech experiments, you’ll be the first to know. If you’re on a similar path, let’s fumble through this together, have a blast, and maybe get in a workout while cracking some machines!

So buckle up, grab your favorite beverage, and let’s jump into the madness that is tech, fitness, and whatever random stuff I find cool. The Trash_P4nda way.
